1.2 - Debugger support
- added debugger support

1.1 - Mac support / bug fixes
**Added Mac support (only INTEL editor version, SILICON still not supported)**
Added Linux support
fixed namespace clash with Unity.Collections package
common code lib will not be included in builds
added check for auto-refresh in Editor - will proide guidance and option to adjust as otherwise full editor reload is triggered for changes
added workaround for Unity file-watcher returning wrong file path on some editor versions
added option to allow disabling DidFieldCountCheck - allowing to detour methods in those cases (eg for Mirror where it'll adjust IL and cause mismatch)
added option to configure FileWatcher paths/filters as in some cases watching root directory was causing performance issues
added minor initial-load optimisations - using session-state for items that do not need to be resolved on every reload

1.0 - First release, included features:
Fast script reload in editor / play-mode (compiles only changed files and hot-reloads them into current play session)
