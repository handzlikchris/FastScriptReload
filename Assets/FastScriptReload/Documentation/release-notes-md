1.4
- added experimental editor-mode hot-reload, you'll need to opt in via Start Screen -> Editor Hot-Reload (please read the notes on that page, playmode workflow is still far superior)
- you can now define User Script Rewrite Overrides - which will allow you to overcome most of existing limitations that cause compilation errors (on a one by one basis)
- big optimization in how long hot-reload part will take, first call will be unaffected when type cache is build but subsequent calls will be significantly quicker
- added 'Exclude References' options - this allows to remove specific dll references from dynamically compiled code (as in some cases you may get 'type defined in both assembly x.dll and y.dll'
- destructors will no longer cause compilation error
- (options opt-in) script rewriting can optionally emit comment - why change was made to help with troubleshooting issues
- Unity assembly reload can be forced off via LockAssemblyReload if specified in options - sometimes even though Auto-Refresh is turned off Editor still tries to recompile changes in playmode which prevents FSR from working 
- new fields support (experimental) will be enabled by default

1.3 - (Experimental) - New fields added in playmode
New fields can be added and used in code
New fields can be adjusted in editor (same as standard fields)
New fields will be initialized to whatever value is specified in code or default value
Experimental feature - at this stage expect some issues
Opt-in - disabled by default to enable go to 'Window -> Fast Script Reload -> Start Screen -> New Fields -> enable'

1.2 - Debugger support
- added debugger support

1.1 - Mac support / bug fixes
**Added Mac support (only INTEL editor version, SILICON still not supported)**
Added Linux support
fixed namespace clash with Unity.Collections package
common code lib will not be included in builds
added check for auto-refresh in Editor - will proide guidance and option to adjust as otherwise full editor reload is triggered for changes
added workaround for Unity file-watcher returning wrong file path on some editor versions
added option to allow disabling DidFieldCountCheck - allowing to detour methods in those cases (eg for Mirror where it'll adjust IL and cause mismatch)
added option to configure FileWatcher paths/filters as in some cases watching root directory was causing performance issues
added minor initial-load optimisations - using session-state for items that do not need to be resolved on every reload

1.0 - First release, included features:
Fast script reload in editor / play-mode (compiles only changed files and hot-reloads them into current play session)
